# Online-Food-Delivery-System
This management system stores data from restaurants and cafes such as details about payments, delivery, menu, offers, reviews, customers, categories, bookings and feedback. Users can fetch details according to requirements from this database. 

Nowadays, everyone is having busy schedules but people in the urban areas
are so busy that they sometimes don’t even have the time to cook their own
food. Our online Food delivery system helps people in ordering various foods and
beverages from some local restaurant through the use of the internet, just by
sitting at home or any place and the order is delivered directly to their desired
location.
Admin can add and remove restaurants and customers. It allows them to
manage customer profiles.They can not change the details like customer phone
no., email, address, user id, order id etc.
Restaurants can register or login. They can add, update, delete food categories
of their menu. They can add, update and delete food items from the menu. They
can also manage prices of the food items listed in their menus. They can also
update additional information like description, photo, etc. for a given food item.
Customers can register, login and edit their profile, search for menu items and
give reviews about restaurants. Customers can add food to their respective cart
and schedule orders. Customers can make payments, retrieve the delivery
person’s contact information, review order history, rate the food, track their
orders in real time and keep track of features like offers, promos etc.
For restaurants we record: Restaurant ID, Restaurant Name, Restaurant
Address, Restaurant ratings, menu items etc.
For customers we record: Customers ID, Customers Name, Customers Address,
Customers Reviews, Cart items etc.The main goal is to maintain restaurant
functions in an effective and accurate manner.
This project helps maintain day-to-day records of food orders in the system. It is
basically keeping a proper record of the database.
